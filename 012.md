# Time manipulation via `block.timestamp` will allow miners to manipulate `block.timestamp` to shift funding rate calculations in `FundingRateFacetImpl.sol`

### Summary

The contract relies heavily on `block.timestamp` for epoch and funding window calculations. Malicious miners could manipulate `block.timestamp` to shift funding rate calculations, especially given the `require` checks around funding windows.

### Root Cause

The `block.timestamp` is a value set by miners, which means it can be manipulated to a certain extent. If a contract relies on `block.timestamp` for critical operations, such as funding rate calculations or cooldown periods, it can be susceptible to manipulation by malicious actors who may influence the block mining process.
In the `chargeFundingRate` function of the `FundingRateFacetImpl` contract, there are several checks that rely on `block.timestamp`:

 If a miner can influence the block time, they could potentially manipulate the funding payment logic to cause the funding rate to be paid prematurely or to miss a payment window. This could be done by deliberately adjusting the block time.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Example calculation:
1. Assume the current `block.timestamp` is `T`.
2. Suppose `windowTime` is set to `1 hour`. If a miner mines a block slightly after `T`, they could make the `block.timestamp` effectively `T + 1`.
3. By manipulating the timestamp, they might bypass certain checks, allowing them to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted.

### Impact

1. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to receive funding payments at unintended times, leading to financial gains at the expense of others.
2. Manipulated timestamps could disrupt the intended flow of the contract, causing actions to be executed out of order or incorrectly.
3. If multiple parties are impacted by manipulated timestamps, it could lead to market inefficiencies and potential loss of trust in the platform.

### Mitigation

1. When possible, use block numbers for critical logic, as they cannot be manipulated like timestamps.
2. Implement delays or require multiple confirmations before executing critical functions that rely on `block.timestamp`. This can help to mitigate potential manipulation.
3. Set reasonable thresholds for allowable discrepancies in time, ensuring that only reasonable variations in `block.timestamp` are accepted.
