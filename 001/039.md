# `settleUpnl` function can be DOSed by other PartyBs/hedgers

### Summary

`settleUpnl` function can be DOSed. Users will not be able to close their positions, which could lead to a loss to the users due to the inability to close their positions. In the report's example, PartyA wants to close its losing position to stop its account from incurring further losses due to unfavorable market conditions. However, since PartyA is unable to close its losing position, PartyA continues to incur more losses and might eventually be liquidated. Furthermore, trading is a time-sensitive activity. Thus, any blockage or delay would eventually lead to a loss of assets.

### Root Cause

- Other PartyBs/hedgers can front-run the transaction and increment their own nonce to block the `settleUpnl` transaction from executing.

### Attack Path


Assume the following scenario:

- PartyA has open positions with PartyB_1 and PartyB_2
- PartyA has one (1) losing position with PartyB_1 (PartyA loses, PartyB_1 wins)
- PartyA has one (1) winning position with Party_2 (PartyA wins, PartyB_2 loses)
- PartyA has zero or low allocated balance

PartyA wants to close its losing position to stop its account from incurring further losses due to unfavorable market conditions. 

However, the close position transaction cannot go through due to an insufficient allocated balance on PartyA's account. This is a similar scenario described in the [Symm IO v0.8.4 documentation](https://docs.symm.io/protocol-architecture/technical-documentation/contracts-documentation-0.8.4#background).

In order for PartyB_1 to close PartyA's position, it first has to execute the `settleUpnl` function to settle PartyA's unrealized profit so that PartyA's allocated balance will be "refilled" with more funds. Once there are sufficient funds in PartyA's allocated balance, PartyB_1 can proceed to fulfill PartyA's closing request.

The only option to increase the PartyA's allocated balance is to close the PartyA's winning position with PartyB_2.

When the `settleUpnl` function is executed, it will verify the signature provided by Muon via the `verifySettlement` function below. Line 20 below shows that the encoded data in the signature includes the nonce of the PartyBs of the positions/quotes where the PnL is to be settled. In this case, PartyB_2's nonce will be included in the signature.

Assume that the time when PartyB_1 fetches the signature is T0. At T0, PartyB_2's nonce is 890. Thus, the signature is signed against encoded data where PartyB_2's nonce is 890.

At T1, PartyB_1 executes the `settleUpnl` function along with the signature. However, PartyB_2 could front-run the transaction and perform certain actions (e.g., open/close position, charge funding rate) that will increment its own nonce to 891. In this case, the nonce in PartyB_1's signature and PartyB_2's nonce will differ, and the `settleUpnl` transaction will revert. PartyB_2 could repeat this continuously DOS or block PartyB_1 attempts to settle UPNL and close PartyA's positions.
