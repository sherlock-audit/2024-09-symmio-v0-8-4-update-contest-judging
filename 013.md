# Inconsistent handling of rates signs leading to large shifts in `partyAAvailableBalance` or `partyBAvailableBalance` in `FundingRateFacetImpl.sol`

### Summary

Inconsistent handling of rates signs in `FundingRateFacetImpl.sol` leading to large shifts in `partyAAvailableBalance` or `partyBAvailableBalance`.

### Root Cause

In the `chargeFundingRate` function of the `FundingRateFacetImpl` contract, there is inconsistent handling of the signs of funding rates for `Party A` and `Party B`. Specifically, the code adjusts the `openedPrice` of quotes based on whether the funding rate is positive or negative, but this logic can lead to unintended consequences if not properly validated.

Example scenario:

Funding rate calculation:
If a positive funding rate is provided, the price is adjusted according to the position type.
If a negative funding rate is provided, the opposite logic is applied, leading to potential confusion.

Inconsistent sign handling:
For `Party A` in a long position, a positive funding rate increases the opened price, while a negative funding rate decreases it. Conversely, for `Party B`, the behavior is reversed. This inconsistency could lead to confusion and unintended financial implications.

Implications:
If the logic is not clear or consistent, it could lead to unintended consequences, such as:
- Incorrect balances being calculated.
- Parties receiving or losing funds they did not intend to.
- Potential disputes between parties regarding the calculation of funding rates.
