# Zero address and trivial inputs could affect contract logic relying on signature validation in `LibMuonV04ClientBase.sol`

### Summary

Zero address and trivial inputs `LibMuonV04ClientBase.sol` could affect contract logic relying on signature validation in.

### Root Cause

In the `verifySignature` function, there is a check to prevent trivial or zero-value inputs, which includes zero addresses or empty parameters. However, improper handling of these checks can still lead to security vulnerabilities, especially if such inputs bypass the validation process. Let’s explore how an attacker might exploit this, and its potential impact.

The contract checks for zero inputs with this line:

While this ensures that trivial values like `0x0` can't be used for some of the key inputs, this does not guarantee that malicious inputs won’t bypass checks under certain conditions (e.g., if `ecrecover` returns `0x0` due to invalid signatures).

Malicious users might try to trigger signature validation failures or force the `ecrecover` to return `0x0`, which could affect contract logic relying on signature validation.

### Attack Path

An attacker could try to force ecrecover to return `address(0)` by providing manipulated inputs. For example, setting the signature, message hash, or other key inputs to certain values might cause the verification to pass incorrectly.
In PoC below, the attacker provides trivial but non-zero values for `signingPubKeyX`, `signature`, and `msgHash`. By manipulating the elliptic curve math internally, they might trick `ecrecover` into returning `address(0)` or passing the validation checks even though the inputs don't represent a legitimate signature.

Also, the contract doesn't properly handle cases where `ecrecover` returns `address(0)`, so the attacker might reuse this to bypass signature verification. This could potentially allow the attacker to replay previously valid transactions with zero inputs, resulting in replay attacks or unauthorized actions.
Since the check relies on the fact that `nonceTimesGeneratorAddress != address(0)`, an attacker could exploit cases where the address becomes zero, such as through invalid `ecrecover` behavior.

### Impact

1. If an attacker can bypass the zero-input checks by manipulating elliptic curve math or forcing `ecrecover` to return `address(0)`, they might be able to forge valid signatures or reuse signatures across transactions. This could lead to unauthorized actions being executed in the system.
2. If trivial or zero values (such as a zero address or zero signature) are accepted in certain edge cases, attackers could replay old transactions or unauthorized signatures, resulting in a loss of funds or control over certain functionalities.
3. The attacker could potentially exploit the system by sending trivial or malformed signatures repeatedly, causing the system to spend gas on failed signature verifications. This could create a denial of service (DoS) attack, making it harder for legitimate users to interact with the contract.

### PoC

```solidity
// Malicious actor attempts to force a valid but trivial signature
uint256 maliciousPubKeyX = 1; // Small, but non-zero value
uint8 pubKeyYParity = 0; // Assuming even Y coordinate
uint256 maliciousSignature = 1; // Small, trivial signature
uint256 maliciousMsgHash = 1; // Small, but non-zero message hash
address maliciousNonceAddress = address(0); // Invalid nonce address

bool success = LibMuonV04ClientBase.verifySignature(
   maliciousPubKeyX,
   pubKeyYParity,
   maliciousSignature,
   maliciousMsgHash,
   maliciousNonceAddress
);

require(success, "Exploit failed");
```

### Mitigation

1. Ensure that all elliptic curve values (like `signingPubKeyX`, `signature`, `msgHash`) are checked thoroughly. Use stricter checks to ensure these values are within valid ranges and avoid passing trivial values like 1, small integers, or zero-like values.
```solidity
require(nonceTimesGeneratorAddress != address(0), "Invalid nonce address");
require(signingPubKeyX > 1e10, "Public key too small"); // Example: Large enough to avoid trivial values
require(signature > 1e10, "Signature too small"); // Similar check
require(msgHash > 1e10, "Message hash too small"); // Avoid trivial hashes
```
2. Ensure that the output of `ecrecover` is always validated. For instance, check that the recovered address is non-zero and matches the expected output. If `ecrecover` returns `address(0)`, the function should revert or return `false`.
