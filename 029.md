# Precision issues for `pnl` and `fee` will cause incorrect financial decisions based on the wrong profit/loss values in `LibQuote.sol`

### Summary

Precision issues for `pnl` and `fee` in `LibQuote.sol` will cause incorrect financial decisions based on the wrong profit/loss values.

### Root Cause

Solidity does not support floating-point numbers. Instead, it uses fixed-point arithmetic, which can lead to precision loss when dealing with very large or very small numbers.

Operations involving division and multiplication by large constants (like `1e18` or `1e36`) can introduce rounding errors. These errors occur because Solidity truncates the decimal part of the result, leading to a loss of precision.

The `uint256` data type, while capable of handling large integers, does not inherently support decimal places. This necessitates manual scaling (e.g., multiplying by 1e18), which can introduce precision issues if not handled carefully.

The calculations for `pnl` and `fee` involve division by `1e18` and `1e36` respectively.

Consider the calculation of `pnl` in `getValueOfQuoteForPartyA` function:
```solidity
pnl = ((currentPrice - quote.openedPrice) * filledAmount) / 1e18;
```
If `currentPrice` and `quote.openedPrice` are very close, the subtraction might result in a very small number, which, when multiplied and then divided by `1e18`, can lead to a loss of precision.

### Impact

1. The `pnl` calculation results in `-1`, which is incorrect and misleading. This could lead to incorrect financial decisions based on the wrong profit/loss values.
2. Over multiple transactions, these small precision errors can accumulate, leading to significant financial discrepancies and potential losses.
3. Users may lose trust in the system if they notice discrepancies in their profit/loss calculations, which could affect the platformâ€™s reputation.

### PoC

Suppose `currentPrice` is $1,000.123456789012345678 and `quote.openedPrice` is $1,000.123456789012345679. The difference is extremely small, but due to precision limitations, it could be rounded off incorrectly.
```solidity
uint256 currentPrice = 1000123456789012345678; // Representing $1,000.123456789012345678 in wei
uint256 openedPrice = 1000123456789012345679; // Representing $1,000.123456789012345679 in wei
uint256 filledAmount = 1000000000000000000; // 1 unit in wei

uint256 pnl = ((currentPrice - openedPrice) * filledAmount) / 1e18;
// pnl = ((1000123456789012345678 - 1000123456789012345679) * 1000000000000000000) / 1e18;
// pnl = (-1 * 1000000000000000000) / 1e18;
// pnl = -1
```

### Mitigation

1. Utilize libraries like `ABDKMathQuad` or `FixedPoint` to handle high-precision arithmetic operations.
2. Instead of using `1e18` and `1e36`, consider using higher precision multipliers if the underlying data supports it.
