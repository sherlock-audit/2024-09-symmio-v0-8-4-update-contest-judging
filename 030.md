# Immediate insolvency vulnerability in `isSolventAfterOpenPosition` function in `LibSolvency.sol`

### Summary

The `isSolventAfterOpenPosition` function in the smart contract has a critical vulnerability that can lead to immediate insolvency after opening a position. This issue arises due to an inaccurate solvency check that does not account for locked balance adjustments, potentially causing users to lose their collateral value adjustment (CVA) and liquidation fees.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the failure to consider the locked balance adjustments when performing the solvency check. The function only checks the available balances after adjusting for the position’s profit or loss, without accounting for the locked balances that should be reserved for collateral and fees.

### Attack Path

1. User opens a position: A user opens a new position by calling the `isSolventAfterOpenPosition function`.
2. Solvency check: The function performs a solvency check based on the available balances after adjusting for the position’s profit or loss.
3. Inaccurate solvency status: Due to the omission of locked balance adjustments, the function may incorrectly determine that the user is solvent.
4. Immediate insolvency: The user becomes immediately insolvent as the actual locked balances are not sufficient to cover the position, leading to potential liquidation and loss of collateral.

Also:
1. User can select a quote with a high leverage ratio, where even small market fluctuations could significantly affect profitability.
2. Submit artificially inflated or deflated market prices through rapid transactions to create misleading profit/loss scenarios.
3. Open and close positions rapidly, presenting a façade of being solvent while actually being in a negative balance.
Example code snippet demonstrating manipulated price submission:
```solidity
// Example of submitting manipulated prices
uint256[] memory quoteIds = [1];
uint256[] memory filledAmounts = [100];
uint256[] memory closedPrices = [120]; // Artificially high price
uint256[] memory marketPrices = [100]; // Actual market price
```

### Impact

1. Users may lose their collateral and incur liquidation fees.
2. The platform may experience increased liquidation events, leading to instability and loss of trust among users.

### PoC

1. Deploy the smart contract: Deploy the contract containing the `isSolventAfterOpenPosition` function.
2. Initialize balances: Set up initial balances for `partyA` and `partyB`.
3. Open a position: Call the `isSolventAfterOpenPosition` function to open a position with specific `quoteIds`, `filledAmounts`, and `marketPrices`.
4. Observe insolvency: Verify that the function incorrectly determines solvency and leads to immediate insolvency upon opening the position.

For example, here’s a simple test contract to demonstrate the immediate insolvency risk in the `isSolventAfterOpenPosition` function. This script will deploy the contract, set up initial balances, and attempt to open a position, showing how the function can lead to insolvency.

                    partyBAvailableBalance -= int256(diff);
                    partyAAvailableBalance += int256(diff);

        filledAmounts[1] = 500 ether;

        uint256[] memory marketPrices = new uint256;
        marketPrices[0] = 1500 ether;
        marketPrices[1] = 2500 ether;

        // This should fail due to immediate insolvency
        require(isSolventAfterOpenPosition(quoteIds, filledAmounts, marketPrices, 0, 0, address(0x1), msg.sender), "Test failed: Immediate insolvency detected");
    }
}
```
Explanation:
1. `The TestSolvency` contract includes the `isSolventAfterOpenPosition` function and a `testImmediateInsolvency` function to demonstrate the issue.
2. Initial balances are set for two parties.
3.  Two quotes are set up, one `LONG` and one `SHORT`.
4. The `testImmediateInsolvency` function attempts to open positions with specific `quoteIds`, filledAmounts, and `marketPrices`.
5. The `require` statement in `testImmediateInsolvency` will fail if the `isSolventAfterOpenPosition` function leads to immediate insolvency.


### Mitigation

Modify the solvency check to include locked balance adjustments, ensuring that the function accurately reflects the actual locked balances.
