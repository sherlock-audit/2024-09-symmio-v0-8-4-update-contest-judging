# Inconsistent liquidation state could result in incorrect liquidation handling or an incomplete process in `DeferredLiquidationFacetImpl.sol`

### Summary

Inconsistent liquidation state in `DeferredLiquidationFacetImpl.sol` could result in incorrect liquidation handling or an incomplete process.

### Root Cause

The inconsistent liquidation state vulnerability can be tested by crafting a PoC below to demonstrate how calling `deferredSetSymbolsPrice` before `deferredLiquidatePartyA` (or vice versa) could result in incorrect liquidation handling or an incomplete process.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Setup the initial liquidation state: Call `deferredLiquidatePartyA` to set the liquidation status for `partyA`.
2. Manipulate the state with out-of-order calls: Call `deferredSetSymbolsPrice` without completing or checking the liquidation process first.
3. Result observation: Check if the liquidation has unintended consequences, like being able to alter the liquidation type or incorrectly set symbols' prices while `partyA` is not fully liquidated.

### Impact

1. Liquidation might fail to process properly, leading to discrepancies in balances for `partyA`. This could allow `partyA` to avoid or delay liquidation unfairly.
2. Incorrect prices or liquidation states could lead to misinformed decisions, causing further financial impact on parties involved.
3. A malicious actor could intentionally perform liquidation actions out of order to exploit inconsistencies and gain financially.

### PoC

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.18;

import "./DeferredLiquidationFacetImpl.sol";

contract TestInconsistentLiquidationState {
    function testOutOfOrderLiquidation(address partyA, DeferredLiquidationSig calldata liquidationSig) external {
        // Step 1: Call deferredSetSymbolsPrice before deferredLiquidatePartyA
        DeferredLiquidationFacetImpl.deferredSetSymbolsPrice(partyA, liquidationSig);

        // Step 2: Now call deferredLiquidatePartyA, which should ideally trigger liquidation, 
        // but the liquidation status and symbol prices may be inconsistently set
        DeferredLiquidationFacetImpl.deferredLiquidatePartyA(partyA, liquidationSig);

        // Check: Observe the liquidation status and symbol prices for `partyA`
        // Ideally, there should be logs or checks to validate if the state is inconsistent
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

To prevent this, implement a state machine pattern in `deferredLiquidatePartyA` and `deferredSetSymbolsPrice` that enforces the correct order of operations. This pattern ensures that `deferredLiquidatePartyA` must complete before `deferredSetSymbolsPrice` can execute, and vice versa.
