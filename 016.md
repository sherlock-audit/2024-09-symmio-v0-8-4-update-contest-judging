create2 works differently on ZkSync Era

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/multiAccount/MultiAccount.sol#L179
create2 works differently on ZkSync Era, it cannot be used for arbitrary code unknown to the compiler. [zkSynce Era Docs](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/differences-with-ethereum.html#create-create2))

The below code snippet won't function correctly because the compiler is not aware of the bytecode beforehand
```solidity
function _deployContract(bytes memory bytecode, bytes32 salt) internal returns (address contractAddress) {
		assembly {
			contractAddress := create2(0, add(bytecode, 32), mload(bytecode), salt)//@audit-issue create2 works differently on zksync
		}
		require(contractAddress != address(0), "MultiAccount: create2 failed");
		emit DeployContract(msg.sender, contractAddress);
		return contractAddress;
	}
```

`MultiAccount._deployContract()` is used by `_deployPartyA()` which is used by `addAccount()` 

Due to not letting the compiler know of bytecode by using `type(myContract).creationCode` to generate the bytecode, `MultiAccount.addAccount()` won't be able to deploy partyA accounts on zksync chain.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

`MultiAccount.addAccount()` won't be able to deploy partyA accounts on zksync chain due to how create2 is used 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `type(myContract).creationCode` to generate the bytecode for the create2, that way compiler is aware of the bytecode beforehand
