# Rounding error when computing `settleAmounts`

### Summary

A rounding error when computing `settleAmounts` could lead to a small amount of PnL will be lost each time. Since this is a trading protocol, it is expected that there will be users who are active traders or entities that perform high-frequency or algorithmic trading, resulting in the loss accumulating to a significant amount.

### Root Cause

- Rounding error when computing `settleAmounts`

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The `settleAmounts` is computed based on the following formula:

$\frac{(updatedPrice - openedPrice) * quantity}{1e18}$  OR $\frac{(openedPrice - updatedPrice) * quantity}{1e18}$

The issue is that in an edge case where the difference between `updatedPrice` and `openedPrice` is small, coupled with small quantity (`LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote)`), the numerator of the equation will be larger than the denominator, leading to `settleAmounts` being rounded down to zero.

In this case, no PnL is settled to PartyA or PartyB's allocated balance (because `settleAmounts` is zero) , yet the quote's `openedPrice` is being updated to the `updatedPrice` at Line 77 below. When `openedPrice` is set to `updatedPrice`, this effectively means that the PnL has settled successfully and users have received the settled PnL to which they are entitled. However, that is not the case here due to rounding error.

A small amount of PnL will be lost each time the rounding error occurs. Since this is a trading protocol, and it is expected that there will be users who are active traders or entities that perform high-frequency or algorithmic trading, resulting in the loss accumulating to a significant amount.

```solidity
File: LibSettlement.sol
15: 	function settleUpnl(
..SNIP..
68: 			if (quote.positionType == PositionType.LONG) {
69: 				settleAmounts[data.partyBUpnlIndex] +=
70: 					((int256(updatedPrices[i]) - int256(quote.openedPrice)) * int256(LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote))) /
71: 					1e18;
72: 			} else {
73: 				settleAmounts[data.partyBUpnlIndex] +=
74: 					((int256(quote.openedPrice) - int256(updatedPrices[i])) * int256(LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote))) /
75: 					1e18;
76: 			}
77: 			quote.openedPrice = updatedPrices[i];
78: 		}
```

### Impact

Lost of assets. A small amount of PnL will be lost each time the rounding error occurs. Since this is a trading protocol, it is expected that there will be users who are active traders or entities that perform high-frequency or algorithmic trading, resulting in the loss accumulating to a significant amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider reverting the function and skip updating the `quote.openedPrice` if the `settleAmount` ends up being zero. If `settleAmount` is zero, there is also no point proceeding with the rest of the `settleUpnl` execution since there is nothing to settle anyway (The allocated balance of either PartyA or PartyB will not increase at the end).
