# The withdraw function didn't do CEI.

withdraw function

This withdraw function in `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/a975aafb06cc3dcb9e4bf9b56ceeb4a9f8163503/protocol-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L26-L36`
didn't CEI.
It is very important function because of payable function, but it didn't do a check.

## Impact
High

## Mitigation

```diff
	function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
		AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
		GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();

+              require( amount <= accountLayout.balances[msg.sender], "AccountFacet: Insufficient balance" );

		require(
			block.timestamp >= accountLayout.withdrawCooldown[msg.sender] + MAStorage.layout().deallocateCooldown,
			"AccountFacet: Cooldown hasn't reached"
		);
		uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) / (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
		accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amountWith18Decimals;
		IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransfer(user, amount);
	}
