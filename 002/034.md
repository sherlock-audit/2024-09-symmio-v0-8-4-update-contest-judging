# AccountFacetImpl.sol:withdraw allows draining of funds

### Summary

The [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L35 ) function deducts an 18-decimal scaled amount from the user's balance but transfers the original, unscaled amount of tokens, potentially allowing users to withdraw more funds than they actually possess, which could lead to draining the contract's funds

### Root Cause

 The oversight in the withdraw function as it  subtracts `amountWith18Decimals`  from the user's balance but transfers the unscaled  `amount` to the user as shown below allows draining of the protocol since users can specify any `amount `

```solidity
	function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
		AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
		GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
		require(
			block.timestamp >= accountLayout.withdrawCooldown[msg.sender] + MAStorage.layout().deallocateCooldown,
			"AccountFacet: Cooldown hasn't reached"
		);
//@audit-info :  calculates the scaled amount
		uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) / (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
		accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amountWith18Decimals;
	//@audit-issue : transfers the unscaled amount to user 
		IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransfer(user, amount);
	}
```
