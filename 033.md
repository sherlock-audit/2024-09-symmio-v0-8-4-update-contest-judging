# Double Accounting of Liquidation Fees Leads to Inflated Balance Calculation and Solvency Bypass

### Summary

Function `LibSolvency::getAvailableBalanceAfterClosePosition()` incorrectly calculates the available balance for Party A and Party B by double accounting for the liquidation fee (lf). This creates an artificial increase in the available balances of both parties, which could lead to the protocol losing funds, during position closure.

### Root Cause

Look at the function: `LibSolvency::getAvailableBalanceAfterClosePosition()` it first calculates both parties' available balances, which is the party's `allocated balance - lockedBalanceOfParty.cva + lockedBalanceOfParty.lf`. These **CVA** (Credit Valuation Adjustment) and **LF** (Liquidation Fee) are the totals for all the quotes (positions) of the particular party (A or B). This means the `partyBAvailableBalance` and `partyAAvailableBalance` variables currently include the `lf` but not the `cva`.

Now if we go down, there is a for loop that processes all the quotes provided to the function. These `quoteIds` are the quote IDs of the quotes where the parties are `partyA` and `partyB`, and the loop iterates through all the quotes with the associated `filledAmount`, `closedPrice`, and `marketPrice`.

```solidity
uint256 unlockedAmount = (filledAmount * (quote.lockedValues.cva + quote.lockedValues.lf)) / LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote);
partyBAvailableBalance += int256(unlockedAmount);
partyAAvailableBalance += int256(unlockedAmount);
```

It again adds the `lf` to the `partyBAvailableBalance` and `partyAAvailableBalance`, which **doubles the accounting of `lf`** and increases the available balance of both parties.



### Internal pre-conditions

* The more will be the liquidationFee(lf) the more harm will caused by this bug

### External pre-conditions

* User or Attcker needs to call the `forceClosePosition()`, before his `availableBalance + cva + lf + lf` goes below 0. as we can see in the function `LibSolvency::getAvailableBalanceAfterClosePosition()`


### Attack Path

Look at the Function `PartyBPositionActionsFacet::fillCloseRequest()` function. It makes a call to `PartyBPositionActionsFacetImpl::fillCloseRequest()`, which in turn calls `LibSolvency::isSolventAfterClosePosition()` to check if both parties are solvent after closing the position or not.

```solidity
(int256 partyBAvailableBalance, int256 partyAAvailableBalance) = getAvailableBalanceAfterClosePosition(
    quoteIds,
    filledAmounts,
    closedPrices,
    marketPrices,
    upnlPartyB,
    upnlPartyA,
    partyB,
    partyA
);
```

With the returned available balance of Party A and Party B, it checks:

```solidity
require(partyBAvailableBalance >= 0 && partyAAvailableBalance >= 0, "LibSolvency: Available balance is lower than zero");
```

Even if their balances are less than 0, this check will pass due to the double accounting of the `lf`. A similar issue will occur in `ForceActionsFacetImpl::forceClosePosition()` (there partyA can act maliciously), as it also uses this function.

### Impact

 The `lf` is typically between `0.1% to 0.5%`, so if the amount is $10,000, the protocol could face a loss of $100 to $500 per transaction. This situation is not rare and can also be exploited by attackers, causing the protocol to lose funds.

So both partyA and partyB can act maliciously and can exploit using this.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correct the accounting error of 'lf' in the function `LibSolvency::getAvailableBalanceAfterClosePosition()`
