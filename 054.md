# dos through lockQuote( )

### Summary

The current implementation of [lockQuote( )](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/PartyBQuoteActions/PartyBQuoteActionsFacet.sol#L20) function lacks proper access control. As a result, any user can lock quotes provided the `quoteId` to cause denial of service.

### Root Cause

The `lockQuote( )` function does not check if the caller `(msg.sender)` is the intended `PartyB` for the specific `quoteId`. It  uses the `onlyPartyB` modifier, to check if the caller is a registered PartyB and  also  `notLiquidated(quoteId)` modifier to check the  liquidation status  of `quoteId`  . This oversight allows any user to lock any unliquidated quote, as long as they have sufficient balance.
