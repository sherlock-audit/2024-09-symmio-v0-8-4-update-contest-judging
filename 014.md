# Incomplete validation of `filledAmount` will lead to bypassing position size limits in `PartyBPositionActionsFacet.sol`

### Summary

Incomplete validation of `filledAmount`  in `PartyBPositionActionsFacet.sol` will lead to bypassing position size limits.

### Root Cause

The `openPosition` and `fillCloseRequest` functions allow Party B to specify a `filledAmount` for a position or close request. However, the contract does not adequately validate this `filledAmount`, allowing Party B to provide excessively small or large values that could result in unwanted behavior.

Same in `PartyBPositionActionsFacetImpl.sol` contract. There is also incomplete validation of `filledAmount` in `openPosition` and `fillCloseRequest`.

### Attack Path

A malicious Party B could exploit the lack of validation on `filledAmount` by providing excessively small or large amounts to manipulate the system.

Steps for exploit:

Small Position Size:
1. Party B could call `openPosition` with a very small `filledAmount` (e.g., `1 wei`).
2. This would create a quote and position with a minuscule amount, leading to leftover quotes that fall below the minimum acceptable quote value.
Example exploit code:
```solidity
// Calling openPosition with a very small filledAmount
partyBFacet.openPosition(quoteId, 1, openedPrice, upnlSig);
```
A malicious Party B could spam the system with multiple positions of tiny sizes, resulting in the contract storage becoming unnecessarily large, increasing gas costs for other users.

Large Position Size:

1. Party B could provide an excessively large f`illedAmount` that exceeds the intended limit for a single trade, bypassing any constraints on position size.
Example exploit code:
```solidity
// Calling openPosition with a very large filledAmount
partyBFacet.openPosition(quoteId, MAX_UINT256, openedPrice, upnlSig);
```
Party B could bypass intended position size limits, opening overly large positions that exceed reasonable risk limits. This could lead to financial manipulation, causing unfair losses to other participants in the system.

### Impact

1. Tiny positions can cause contract bloat, unnecessary gas consumption, and cluttered state, without any real economic activity taking place.
2. Large filledAmount values can bypass limits on acceptable position sizes, allowing malicious actors to open disproportionally large positions, leading to potential system instability or unfair financial gain.
3.  If a minuscule amount of the position is opened, the leftover open portion might remain indefinitely, consuming gas and clogging the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a check to ensure that `filledAmount` is within reasonable bounds, both for minimum and maximum size.

Example:
```solidity
require(filledAmount >= MIN_POSITION_SIZE, "PartyBPositionActionsFacet: filledAmount too small");
require(filledAmount <= MAX_POSITION_SIZE, "PartyBPositionActionsFacet: filledAmount too large");
```
