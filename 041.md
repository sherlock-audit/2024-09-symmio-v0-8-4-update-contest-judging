# Ineffective settlement cooldown measure

### Summary

An ineffective settlement cooldown measure allows hedgers to settle any number of quotes/positions involving other hedgers in one go (e.g., within a single block/TX). As a result, it could lead to asset loss for PartyB (victim) because another trader (the exploiter) can settle positions prematurely at times that are disadvantageous to PartyB (victim)

For example, in a highly volatile market, if PartyB’s positions temporarily incur a loss due to sudden market fluctuations, the exploiter could immediately settle these positions before the market has a chance to recover. This premature settlement forces Party B to realize losses that might have otherwise been avoided if the positions had remained open.

### Root Cause

1. The cooldown mapping key is set based on `[msg.sender][partyB][partyA]` instead of `[msg.sender][partyB]`
2. Hedgers can settle as any number of quotes/positions involving other hedgers in one go (e.g., within a single block/TX) as long as the PartyA differs each time.

### Attack Path

Assume two PartyB/hedgers

- PartyB_1 = Rasa
- PartyB_2 = PerpsHub

PartyB_1 (Rasa) has five (5) quotes with different PartyAs.

- Quote 1 - PartyB_1 with PartyA_1
- Quote 2 - PartyB_1 with PartyA_2
- Quote 3 - PartyB_1 with PartyA_3
- Quote 4 - PartyB_1 with PartyA_4
- Quote 5 - PartyB_1 with PartyA_5

According to the documentation, the cooldown mechanism prevents a hedger from excessively closing the positions of other hedgers.

> **Cooldown Mechanism**: To prevent hedgers from repeatedly settling UPNL for quotes involving other hedgers, a cooldown period is enforced. A hedger cannot settle UPNL for another hedger's quotes more than once in a period.

However, PartyB_2 (PerpsHub) can close all five (5) quotes of PartyB_1 (Rasa) without being subjected to any cooldown or restriction (as long as the PartyA is different), which is excessive.

1. PartyB_2 close Quote 1 of PartyB_1. ``lastUpnlSettlementTimestamp[PartyB_2][PartyB_1][PartyA_1]`` is zero at this point. Thus, the cooldown check passes. `lastUpnlSettlementTimestamp[PartyB_2][PartyB_1][PartyA_1]` will be set to the current time (`block.timestamp`) at the end.
2. PartyB_2 close Quote 2 of PartyB_1. `lastUpnlSettlementTimestamp[PartyB_2][PartyB_1][PartyA_2]` is zero at this point. Thus, the cooldown check passes. `lastUpnlSettlementTimestamp[PartyB_2][PartyB_1][PartyA_2]` will be set to the current time (`block.timestamp`) at the end.
3. PartyB_2 repeats the same for Quote 3, 4, and 5 of PartyB_1.

 If PartyB_1 has 50 quotes/positions, PartyB_2 can proceed to close all of them in one go.

95: 				MAStorage.layout().lastUpnlSettlementTimestamp[msg.sender][partyB][partyA] = block.timestamp;

```

### Impact

The issue could lead to asset loss for PartyB (victim) because another trader (the exploiter) can settle positions prematurely at times that are disadvantageous to PartyB.

For example, in a highly volatile market, if PartyB’s positions temporarily incur a loss due to sudden market fluctuations, the exploiter could immediately settle these positions before the market has a chance to recover. This premature settlement forces PartyB to realize losses that might have otherwise been avoided if the positions had remained open.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The number of quotes/positions involving other hedgers that a hedger can settle in one go (e.g., within a single block/TX) must be restricted (e.g., maximum three positions within a single block/TX + cooldown period). The codebase can track the number of quotes/positions involving other hedgers that a hedger has already settled within the current block/TX and revert if it exceeds the maximum limit.

Alternatively, a more restrictive approach can be adopted. The mapping index for the cooldown should be per `caller:partyB` instead of `caller:partyB:partyA` to prevent PartyB from excessively settling another hedger's quotes within the cooldown period.

```diff
if (!isForceClose && msg.sender != partyB) {
  require(
    block.timestamp >=
-      MAStorage.layout().lastUpnlSettlementTimestamp[msg.sender][partyB][partyA] + 
+      MAStorage.layout().lastUpnlSettlementTimestamp[msg.sender][partyB] + 
      MAStorage.layout().settlementCooldown,
    "LibSettlement: Cooldown should be passed"
  );
-  MAStorage.layout().lastUpnlSettlementTimestamp[msg.sender][partyB][partyA] = block.timestamp;
+  MAStorage.layout().lastUpnlSettlementTimestamp[msg.sender][partyB] = block.timestamp;
}
```
