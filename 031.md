# Unchecked low-level call in `_call` function will cause unexpected behavior of the contract `SymmioPartyA.sol`

### Summary

The `_call` function in the `SymmioPartyA` contract uses a low-level call to interact with the `symmioAddress` without verifying the success of the call. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks if the call fails or if symmioAddress is not a contract.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of a low-level call without proper checks to ensure the callâ€™s success and to verify that `symmioAddress` is a valid contract address.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker could set `symmioAddress` to a non-contract address.
2. When `_call` is executed, the low-level call would fail silently.
3. The contract would behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to loss of funds or other unintended consequences.

### Impact

1. Loss of funds if the contract relies on the success of the call for financial transactions.
2. Unexpected behavior of the contract, leading to potential exploits or denial of service.

### PoC

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.18;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract SymmioPartyA is AccessControl {
    bytes32 public constant MULTIACCOUNT_ROLE = keccak256("MULTIACCOUNT_ROLE");
    address public symmioAddress;

    constructor(address admin, address multiAccountAddress, address symmioAddress_) {
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
        _grantRole(MULTIACCOUNT_ROLE, multiAccountAddress);
        symmioAddress = symmioAddress_;
    }

    event SetSymmioAddress(address oldSymmioContractAddress, address newSymmioContractAddress);

    function setSymmioAddress(address symmioAddress_) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        emit SetSymmioAddress(symmioAddress, symmioAddress_);
        symmioAddress = symmioAddress_;
    }

    function _call(bytes memory _callData) external onlyRole(MULTIACCOUNT_ROLE) returns (bool _success, bytes memory _resultData) {
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = symmioAddress.call{ value: 0 }(_callData);
        require(success, "Call failed");
        return (success, result);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that the `call` is checked for success and that `symmioAddress` is a valid contract address before making the call.
```solidity
function _call(bytes memory _callData) external onlyRole(MULTIACCOUNT_ROLE) returns (bool _success, bytes memory _resultData) {
    require(symmioAddress.code.length > 0, "Address is not a contract");
    (bool success, bytes memory result) = symmioAddress.call{ value: 0 }(_callData);
    require(success, "Call failed");
    return (success, result);
}
```
