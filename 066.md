# Unchecked ERC20 Transfer Return Value Leads to Potential Fund Loss in Bridge Withdrawals : `BridgeFacetImpl.sol:withdrawReceivedBridgeValue`

### Summary

A critical oversight in the `withdrawReceivedBridgeValue` function of the BridgeFacetImpl contract will cause silent failures during token transfers, potentially leading to significant fund loss for users. This vulnerability arises because the function fails to verify the success of ERC20 token transfers, allowing transactions to be marked as complete even when the actual token transfer fails.

### Root Cause

In BridgeFacetImpl.sol:withdrawReceivedBridgeValue, the function executes an ERC20 token transfer without checking its return value:
line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/Bridge/BridgeFacetImpl.sol#L42C2-L55C3

function:
```solidity
function withdrawReceivedBridgeValue(uint256 transactionId) internal {
		GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
		BridgeStorage.Layout storage bridgeLayout = BridgeStorage.layout();
		require(transactionId <= bridgeLayout.lastId, "BridgeFacet: Invalid transactionId");

		BridgeTransaction storage bridgeTransaction = bridgeLayout.bridgeTransactions[transactionId];

		require(bridgeTransaction.status == BridgeTransactionStatus.RECEIVED, "BridgeFacet: Already withdrawn");
		require(block.timestamp >= MAStorage.layout().deallocateCooldown + bridgeTransaction.timestamp, "BridgeFacet: Cooldown hasn't reached");
		require(msg.sender == bridgeTransaction.bridge, "BridgeFacet: Sender is not the transaction's bridge");

		bridgeTransaction.status = BridgeTransactionStatus.WITHDRAWN;
		IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransfer(bridgeTransaction.bridge, bridgeTransaction.amount);
	}
```

**This implementation violates a crucial smart contract security best practice: always verify the success of external calls, especially token transfers.**

`Detailed Analysis:`

1. ERC20 Standard Compliance:
The ERC20 standard specifies that the transfer function should return a boolean indicating success. However, not all tokens strictly adhere to this. Some tokens, like USDT, return false on failure instead of reverting. Others might not return anything at all. By not checking the return value, the contract assumes all transfers succeed, which is a dangerous assumption.
2. State Inconsistency:
The function updates the transaction status to WITHDRAWN before the actual transfer occurs. If the transfer fails silently, the contract's state no longer reflects reality. This discrepancy between recorded and actual balances can lead to severe issues in fund accounting and user withdrawals.
3. Violation of Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern:
The current implementation violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. It changes the contract's state (setting status to WITHDRAWN) before interacting with an external contract (the token transfer). This order of operations exacerbates the issue by marking transactions as complete before ensuring the transfer's success.
4. Scope of Impact:
This vulnerability affects a core function of the bridge mechanism. Given that bridge operations often involve substantial amounts of funds, the potential for large-scale fund loss is significant.
5. Ease of Exploitation:
While this isn't an "exploit" in the traditional sense, it doesn't require malicious intent to cause issues. Natural occurrences like insufficient contract balance or temporary token contract issues could trigger this vulnerability.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a withdrawal of received bridge value.
2. The withdrawReceivedBridgeValue function is called with a valid transaction ID.
3. The function updates the transaction status to WITHDRAWN.
4. The function attempts to transfer tokens, but the transfer fails silently (e.g., due to insufficient balance).
5. The function completes without reverting, despite the failed transfer.
6. The transaction is recorded as successfully withdrawn, but no tokens are actually transferred.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is severe:

1. Direct Fund Loss: Users may lose funds as failed transfers go undetected.
2. State Inconsistency: The recorded state of withdrawals becomes inconsistent with actual token balances.
3. Trust Erosion: Repeated instances of this issue could severely damage user trust in the protocol.
4. Potential for Exploitation: Malicious actors could potentially exploit this to drain funds by creating situations where transfers consistently fail.

### PoC

EXAMPLE:
```solidity
contract MaliciousToken is IERC20 {
    // ... standard ERC20 functions

    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        // Always return true but don't actually transfer
        return true;
    }
}

// In a test scenario
function testFailedWithdraw() public {
    MaliciousToken maliciousToken = new MaliciousToken();
    setCollateral(address(maliciousToken));
    
    uint256 transactionId = createBridgeTransaction(100);
    
    // Attempt to withdraw
    withdrawReceivedBridgeValue(transactionId);
    
    // The transaction is marked as withdrawn, but no tokens were transferred
    assert(getBridgeTransaction(transactionId).status == BridgeTransactionStatus.WITHDRAWN);
    assert(maliciousToken.balanceOf(bridgeAddress) == 0);
}
```

### Mitigation

**To resolve this issue, implement proper checks using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library**

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

function withdrawReceivedBridgeValue(uint256 transactionId) internal {
    GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
    BridgeStorage.Layout storage bridgeLayout = BridgeStorage.layout();
    // ... (other code)
    // @audit here use SafeERC20!
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(appLayout.collateral), bridgeTransaction.bridge, bridgeTransaction.amount);
    bridgeTransaction.status = BridgeTransactionStatus.WITHDRAWN;
}
```

This modification ensures that:

The transfer will revert if it fails, preventing silent failures.
The state is updated only after a successful transfer, maintaining consistency.
The contract follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
