# pending quotes and  balances for Party B are not cleared

### Summary

The [liquidatePartyB()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/libraries/LibLiquidation.sol#L23) function uses `delete quoteLayout.partyBPendingQuotes[partyB][partyA]` to clear  pending quotes and reset balances, but these operations do not fully reset nested mappings within the Layout struct. The delete operation doesn't traverse through nested mappings as it lacks key set information

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/libraries/LibLiquidation.sol#L77


Solidity's `delete`  keyword when dealing with complex data structures, particularly nested mappings within structs. The delete operation does not recursively clear all nested elements.

However,  the function [liquidatePartyB()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/libraries/LibLiquidation.sol#L23)   uses the `delete` to reset liquidator state which is a  nested mappings within  the [Layout](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/storages/QuoteStorage.sol#L71 ) struct .
