# Deadline Bypass in Force Close Mechanism Leading to Exploitation

### Summary

`partyB` can make losses to `partyA` by not completing the `partyA` request to close quote. Also making `partyA`, not to able to call the `forceClose` function

#### Root Cause

#### Protocol Design Explained
Look at the function `ForceActionsFacetImpl::forceClosePosition()`. It allows Party A to force close their position by referencing  data before the `block.timestamp` with some checks. Here are those checks:

```solidity
require(sig.endTime + maLayout.forceCloseSecondCooldown <= quote.deadline, "PartyBFacet: Close request is expired");
require(sig.startTime >= quote.statusModifyTimestamp + maLayout.forceCloseFirstCooldown, "PartyAFacet: Cooldown not reached");
require(sig.endTime <= block.timestamp - maLayout.forceCloseSecondCooldown, "PartyAFacet: Cooldown not reached");
```

Let’s take a simple example:

1. Party A wants to close their position and calls `PartyAFacet::requestToClosePosition()`, which will make some changes.  
   Let's assume the following data:  
   - `maLayout.forceCloseFirstCooldown = 60`  
   - `maLayout.forceCloseSecondCooldown = 60`  
   - `quote.statusModifyTimestamp = block.timestamp = 314`  
   - `quote.deadline = deadline = 500`

```solidity
quote.statusModifyTimestamp = block.timestamp;
quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.CLOSE_PENDING;
quote.requestedClosePrice = closePrice;
quote.quantityToClose = quantityToClose;
quote.orderType = orderType;
quote.deadline = deadline;
```

2. Now, at `block.timestamp = 502`, the user selects a timeframe from `380 (sig.startTime)` to `430 (sig.endTime)`, selects a price, verifies it with Binance, and gets a signature from Muon. They then call `ForceActionsFacet::forceClosePosition()` with the signature.

3. At `block.timestamp = 502`, although this bypasses the `quote.deadline (500)`, the transaction will still be processed.

4. If we look at the first check:  
   `sig.endTime(430) + maLayout.forceCloseSecondCooldown(60) <= quote.deadline(500) -> (490 <= 500)` ✅

5. If we look at the second check:  
   `sig.startTime(380) >= quote.statusModifyTimestamp(314) + maLayout.forceCloseFirstCooldown(60) -> (380 >= 374)` ✅

6. The third check:  
   `sig.endTime(430) <= block.timestamp(502) - maLayout.forceCloseSecondCooldown(60) -> 430 <= 442` ✅

As a result, the transaction will execute and be processed. The purpose of showing this is to illustrate that it doesn't matter whether the quote's deadline has passed relative to the current `block.timestamp`. This is an intended design of the protocol to ensure that Party A doesn’t face any losses due to Party B's inaction. If there were a check between the `block.timestamp` and the deadline, it could lead to losses for Party A. Party A will try to close the position when they are in profit, and if Party B does not accept the request, Party A's only option would be to force close. If that fails due to the deadline, Party A would have to expire their position, open it again, and lose the opportunity to close the position at a time when they were in high profit. This could cause Party A to face a loss due to Party B's actions, which is why the protocol has not implemented such checks.

### Root Cause
* `PartyAFacet::expireQuote()` can be called by anyone , so when the `partyA` status is `close_pending` , also `quote.deadline < block.timestamp` so `partyB` can call `PartyAFacet::expireQuote()` to stop `partyA` in force closing of the position as the `partyB` is in high loss.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `partyB` should act maliciously.(partyB can act malicious as it is a semi-trusted role. Also partyB is considered malicious in previous [findings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical-judging/issues/41#issuecomment-1724285656)

### External pre-conditions

No such condition's required

### Attack Path

As given in `Initialize.fixtures.ts`, `forceCloseFirstCooldown = 300` and `forceCloseSecondCooldown = 120`:

1. Party A has a quote with Party B, and Party A is in high profit while Party B is in high loss.

2. Party A calls `PartyAFacet::requestToClosePosition()` to close the request with a deadline 7 minutes (420 secs) from the current `block.timestamp`. Party A can give any deadline as there is no check for that.  
   - `quote.statusModifyTimestamp = block.timestamp = 300`  
   - `quote.deadline = deadline = 720` (300 + 420)

3. Party B, in high loss, acts maliciously by not accepting the request, waiting for the prices to move in their favor before closing the position(partyB can act malicious as it is a semi-trusted role. Also partyB is considered malicious in previous [findings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-symmetrical-judging/issues/41#issuecomment-1724285656)).

4. At `t = 500`, Party A is still waiting for Party B to fill the close quote request. To call `ForceActionsFacet::forceClosePosition()`, `sig.startTime()` should be greater than `quote.statusModifyTimestamp(300) + 300`, and with `currentTimestamp = 500`, Party A is unable to call `forceClosePosition()` yet.

5. At `t = 721` or later, Party A will be eligible to pass all the checks and will select a timeframe when the desired price was attained, verify it with Binance, get a signature from Muon, and call `ForceActionsFacet::forceClosePosition()` with the signature.

6. Before Party A can act, Party B front-runs the transaction and calls `PartyAFacet::expireQuote()` with the `quoteId`. Since the current `block.timestamp(721)` exceeds `quote.deadline(720)`, the function executes and modifies the `quote` at the storage level. Party B could have called this function as soon as the condition `quote.deadline < block.timestamp` was met other then frontrunning it.

7. Party A's `ForceActionsFacet::forceClosePosition()` call will now fail since `quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.OPENED` and `quote.statusModifyTimestamp = block.timestamp`.

8. Hence partyA will not be able to close his position when he wanted, and now he can't call `ForceActionsFacet::forceClosePosition()` with again that timeframe as `quote.statusModifyTimestamp` has changed with current block.timestamp. As a result, Party A cannot close the position as planned. Due to the volatile crypto market, Party A could now face losses while Party B profits from the market shift. 

This vulnerability can also be exploited in other ways by Party B if Party A sets a shorter deadline. Party B could exploit the situation more easily since there are no checks on the deadline. Party A can set any value, and given that people often prefer quicker results, it's very likely that Party A might set a deadline of less than 5 minutes.


### Impact


- Losses for Party A:
- Party A will not be able to close their position at their intended time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

* Implement some checks while setting `quote.deadline`.
* Also add some modifier in `expireQuote()`
