# The depositor can deposit for suspended user.

### Summary

## Medium
In the function depositFor(address user, uint256 amount) the depositor can deposit for suspended user.
The depositor isn't able to know who is suspended user.
So the asset that the depositor deposited is locked because the suspended user can't withdraw from the contract.

### Root Cause

In `AccountFacet.sol:26` `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L25-L28`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Adam is a suspended user because of previous malicious action. 2. John doesn't know that Adam is suspended so John deposit for Adam 100ETH. 
As the result 100ETH of John is locked.
