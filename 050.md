# Emergency close might be blocked due to insufficient allocated balance

### Summary

Emergency close might be blocked due to insufficient PartyA's allocated balance. During urgent situations where emergency mode is activated, the positions need to be promptly closed to avoid negative events that could potentially lead to serious loss of funds (e.g. the protocol is compromised, and the attacker is planning to or has started draining funds from the protocols). However, if the emergency closure of positions is blocked or delayed due to the above-mentioned issue, it might lead to unrecoverable losses.

### Root Cause

- Emergency close does not handle an edge case where PartyA has insufficient allocated balance

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Assuming a similar scenario mentioned in the [Symm IO v0.8.3 documentation](https://docs.symm.io/protocol-architecture/technical-documentation/contracts-documentation-0.8.4#detailed-example).

Bob (Party A) has three open positions and zero allocated balance:

1. Position 1 with Rasa Hedger (Party B1):
   - Unrealized Profit: $300
   - Quote ID: `1`
2. Position 2 with PerpsHub Hedger (Party B2):
   - Unrealized Profit: $100
   - Quote ID: `2`
3. Position 3 with PerpsHub Hedger (Party B2):
   - Unrealized Loss: $250
   - Quote ID: `3`

PartyB wants to emergency close Bob's Position 3 via the `emergencyClosePosition` function, which has an unrealized loss of $250. However, since Bob has zero allocated balance, the loss in Position 3 cannot cover this loss upon closing, and an attempt to emergency close will revert.

113: 			LibAccount.partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(upnlSig.upnlPartyA, accountLayout.allocatedBalances[quote.partyA], quote.partyA) >= 0,
114: 			"PartyBFacet: PartyA is insolvent"
115: 		);
116: 		require(
117: 			LibAccount.partyBAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(upnlSig.upnlPartyB, quote.partyB, quote.partyA) >= 0,
118: 			"PartyBFacet: PartyB should be solvent"
119: 		);
120: 		accountLayout.partyBNonces[quote.partyB][quote.partyA] += 1;
121: 		accountLayout.partyANonces[quote.partyA] += 1;
122: 		LibQuote.closeQuote(quote, filledAmount, upnlSig.price);
123: 	}
```

### Impact

During urgent situations where emergency mode is activated, the positions need to be promptly closed to avoid negative events that could potentially lead to serious loss of funds (e.g. the protocol is compromised, and the attacker is planning to or has started draining funds from the protocols). However, if the emergency closure of positions is blocked or delayed due to the above-mentioned issue, it might lead to unrecoverable losses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing the `settleUpnl` function within the `emergencyClosePosition` function so that PartyB can proceed to settle PartyA's open positions to ensure that PartyA's allocated balance will have sufficient balance to allow the position to be emergency closed.
