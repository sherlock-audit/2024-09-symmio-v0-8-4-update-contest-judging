# transferToBridge is missing some checks for amount it can be zero

### Summary

The missing check in 'BridgeFaceImpl.sol' or 'BridgeFacet' may cause use gas not necessary if parameter 'amount' is 0
also
Having transactions with a value 'amount' of zero can cause problems in contract audits and make it difficult to track actual transactions. This can open space for possible failures or confusion in transaction validation.


### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/Bridge/BridgeFacetImpl.sol#L18
In ```BridgeFacet.sol:transferToBridge(...)``` contains the calling ` BridgeFacetImpl.transferToBridge(...)` its a library but there isnt checks for amount it can be zero in ```BridgeFaceImpl.sol:transferToBridge(....)```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This may result in unnecessary gas consumption for the user. 

but for an attacker it can create fake transaction. using 0 of course you need to spend that much gas but this can make auditing and tracking for transactiob difficult

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

in `BridgeFacetImpl.sol:transferToBridge#19` should be adding one checks require(amount > 0)
