# fallback allows invalid facet addresses to be used

### Summary

The  [fallback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/Diamond.sol#L47) function in the Diamond contract executes delegatecall to facet addresses without verifying if code exists at those addresses. This allows calls to empty facet addresses to succeed

### Root Cause

 The [fallback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-symmio-v0-8-4-update-contest/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/Diamond.sol#L47) function  doesn't verify if there's actually code at the `facet` address before making the `delegatecall`.

 After the `delegatecall`, there's also no verification of the returned data length as seen in the code below :
 
```solidity
fallback() external payable {
		LibDiamond.DiamondStorage storage ds;
		bytes32 position = LibDiamond.DIAMOND_STORAGE_POSITION;
		// get diamond storage
		assembly {
			ds.slot := position
		}
		// get facet from function selector
		address facet = ds.facetAddressAndSelectorPosition[msg.sig].facetAddress;
		require(facet != address(0), "Diamond: Function does not exist");
		// Execute external function from facet using delegatecall and return any value.
		assembly {
			// copy function selector and any arguments
			calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())
		
              //@audit-issue : the size of the facet address not  checked 
		//@audit-issue :  external call made to facet not checked
			let result := delegatecall(gas(), facet, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
			// get any return value
			returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())
			// return any return value or error back to the caller
			switch result
			case 0 {
				revert(0, returndatasize())
			}
			default {
				return(0, returndatasize())
			}
		}
	}
```
 

Since calls to addresses without code always succeed, this could lead to bypassing critical logic if an attacker manages to manipulate the diamond storage to point to an empty address.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A call to an address without deployed code always succeeds . This means that if an attacker manages to manipulate the diamond storage to point a function selector to an empty address, the `delegatecal` call to non existence  facet  address will still execute 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


1 .Before making the external call, the size of the contract should be checked to ensure it has code.
2 . If the external call is  successful, the length of the returned data should be verified to match the expected length.
